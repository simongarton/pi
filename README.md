# pi

Raspberry Pi code. One of my lockdown projects, I have about five or six
Pis lying around the place, or attached to a nice frame and displaying information.

Best app so far is my Weather app, which uses a SenseHat to display weather
forecasts from OpenWeatherMap.org.

Next I'm working on a proper IoT weather station with an InitialState dashboard.
